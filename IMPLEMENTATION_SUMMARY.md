### 1. General Route Templates (17 routes)
All general routes now have modern, responsive templates with dynamic content loading:

- **`/classes`** - Available classes with search, filtering, and enrollment tracking
- **`/resources`** - Learning resources library with type and subject filtering
- **`/sessions`** - Training sessions with status tracking and join functionality
- **`/communications`** - Communication center with forums, announcements, and messages
- **`/community`** - Community hub with study groups, discussions, and social feed
- **`/reports`** - Analytics and reporting dashboard with customizable reports
- **`/progress`** - Progress tracking with course completion and learning paths
- **`/skills`** - Skill development with assessment and recommendations
- **`/career`** - Career guidance and planning tools
- **`/content`** - Content management and creation tools
- **`/trainers`** - Trainer profiles and management

- **`/interests`** - Interest tracking and recommendations

### 2. API Endpoints (15+ endpoints)
Comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for dynamic data loading:

#### Data Retrieval Endpoints:
- `GET /api/classes` - Returns available classes with enrollment data
- `GET /api/sessions` - Returns training sessions with combined class information

- `GET /api/study-groups` - Returns study groups and membership data
- `GET /api/discussions` - Returns community discussions
- `GET /api/community-feed` - Returns social feed posts
- `GET /api/recent-reports` - Returns generated reports
- `GET /api/course-progress` - Returns user course progress
- `GET /api/learning-path` - Returns learning path progression
- `GET /api/achievements` - Returns user achievements

- **Session Management**: Proper authentication checks for protected features
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to static data when API calls fail
- **Data Transformation**: Intelligent combination of session and class data for comprehensive views

### 4. Frontend Features
- **Dynamic Loading**: All templates use JavaScript to fetch data from API endpoints
- **Interactive Elements**: Search, filtering, and sorting capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based responsive layouts
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error handling, and smooth transitions
- **Authentication Integration**: Login checks for protected features

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack:
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0** - Responsive UI framework
